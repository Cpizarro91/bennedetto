Keep these nitpicks in mind when submitting pull requests

### Commit Messages

* Git's recommendation of (1) a subject less than 50 characters, (2) a blank line following the subject, and (3) a body wrapped at 72 characters per line
* Present tense
* Feature in subject if applicable

_Example:_

    Authentication: removes password hardcodes from config

    Refactors authentication to allow the user to choose
    their password, rather than hard coding one for them

### PEP8

I'd this project to follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) as closely as it can.  However, in the spirit of avoiding _foolish consistency_, certain things are fine.

* Lines falling past 80 characters are fine, so long as they are readable

_(more exceptions to come)_

### JavaScript

I'll add some more pedantic rules when I actually add some JavaScript : )
